# Next steps

- improve support for different types and cases in current implementation

- build a native SSTable reader in the cuDF project, e.g. `cudf.from_sstable()`

- read DSE SSTable format

# Other applications

- parsing different SSTable versions across different programming languages could help in migration from Cassandra to Astra

- could also use Kaitai to parse and document CQL protocol

# Questions?

I'll do my best :)
